# durdiff

A tool for comparing the contents of two directories.
Durdiff will list files as well as directories contained in the two directories you wish to compare.

## Running

Durdiff requires two arguments - the paths of the two directories you wish to compare.

Additionally durdiff will accept an `--all` (or `-a`) flag to enable showing hidden files (files whose name begins with a period).
Durdiff will also accept an `--expand` (or `-e`) flag to fully expand the input paths in the output.

Naturally, a `--version` (or `-v`) will print the current version of durdiff you are using.
Finally, the `--help` (or `-h`) flag will show a terse recap of the options laid out here.
